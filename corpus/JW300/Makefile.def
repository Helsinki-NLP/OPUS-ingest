SRCHTML=<p>JW300 is a parallel corpus of over 300 languages with around 100 thousand parallel sentences per language pair on average. The corpus has been compiled by Željko Agić and Ivan Vulić.</p> Version 1b provides some small corrections to the first release (some languages and language variants were missing and some smaller fixes in pre-processing.)\

DOWNLOADINFO=<p>Below you can download data files for all language pairs in the <a href="http://opus.nlpl.eu/trac/wiki/DataFormats">OPUS-specific XML format</a>. For each bitext you can find the standoff sentence alignment file in XCES Align format that links sentences from documents in source and target language. JW300 includes a large number of languages and, therefore, we do not provide pre-compiled plain text bitexts in Moses and TMX format. We recommend to use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opustools-pkg/">opus-tools</a> instead to convert the data into the format you like to use. <code>opus_read</code> from that package provides a convenient tool for reading the native aligned XML files and to convert them to plain text (moses) and TMX format. The tool can also be used to fetch relevant files from OPUS on the fly and to filter the data if necssary. <a href="https://pypi.org/project/opustools-pkg/">Read the documentation</a> for more details. Here is a simple example for using <code>opus_read</code> to download the Afrikaans-Bulgarian bitext from JW300 and to convert it to plain text (Moses) format (see the -wm flag):\
<blockquote>\
<code>\
pip install opustools-pkg</br>\
opus_read -d JW300 -s af -t bg -wm moses -w jw300.af jw300.bg\
</code>\
</blockquote>\
This will ask to download the relevant data files from OPUS (unless you already have them on your local system) and after downloading it will convert the corpus to aligned plain text files stored in the files specifier with -w. Note that the resources from this corpus can also be found with the <a href="/index.php">resource search tool on the top-level page of OPUS</a>. Note that the language IDs do not necessarily comply with ISO639 standards. The following file provides a mapping of languages to the IDs used in the corpus:\
<ul>\
<li><a href="https://object.pouta.csc.fi/OPUS-JW300/v1/languages.json">languages.json</a></li>\
<li><a href="https://object.pouta.csc.fi/OPUS-JW300/v1/language_statistics.json">language_statistics.json</a></li>\
</ul>\
