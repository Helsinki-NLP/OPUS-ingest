## JW300 parallel data

The data is organized as follows:

- `articles.tar.gz`: one sentence per line, one file per article, data for all languages
- `aligned_split.{aa,ab,ac,ad,ae}`: sentence alignments for each language pair, a `tar.gz split`
- a couple `.json` files with basic stats like language names and numbers of articles per year per publication
- our ACL 2019 paper
