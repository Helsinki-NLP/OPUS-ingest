These are the xml files that I'm using now that have the file pairs marked in the first line of the xml file:
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/freecorpus/converted
These are the same files as above but in the original format:
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/freecorpus/orig
And these are the sentence aligned files that they have:
svn co https://gtsvn.uit.no/biggies/trunk/mt
