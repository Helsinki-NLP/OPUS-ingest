SRCHTML=<p>A collection of documents from <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/">http://www.opensubtitles.org/</a>.<br/><b>IMPORTANT:</b> If you use the OpenSubtitle corpus: <br/>Please, add a link to <b>http://www.opensubtitles.org/</b> to your website and to your reports and publications produced with the data! I promised this when I got the data from the providers of that website!</p> <p> This is a slightly cleaner version of the subtitle collection using improved sentence alignment and better language checking.</p>
