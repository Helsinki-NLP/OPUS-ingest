I used this query to dump db:
SELECT a.MovieID, IDSubtitleFile, SubLanguageID, IDSubtitle, SubActualCD, SubSumCD, SubFormat, MovieName, MovieYear, MovieImdbID, UserRank, SubDownloadsCnt, SeriesIMDBParent, SeriesSeason, SeriesEpisode, SubHearingImpaired, SubFormat
FROM subs_search_cache a
LEFT JOIN subs_subtitle_file b ON IDSubtitle = SubtitleID
WHERE 1 = 1
AND SubEnabled = 1
LIMIT 1
INTO OUTFILE '/backup/db1/export.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
