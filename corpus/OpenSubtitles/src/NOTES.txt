I used this query to dump db:
SELECT a.MovieID, IDSubtitleFile, SubLanguageID, IDSubtitle, SubActualCD, SubSumCD, SubFormat, MovieName, MovieYear, MovieImdbID, UserRank, SubDownloadsCnt, SeriesIMDBParent, SeriesSeason, SeriesEpisode, SubHearingImpaired, SubFormat
FROM subs_search_cache a
LEFT JOIN subs_subtitle_file b ON IDSubtitle = SubtitleID
WHERE 1 = 1
AND SubEnabled = 1
LIMIT 1
INTO OUTFILE '/backup/db1/export.csv'
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
ENCLOSED BY '"'
FIELDS ESCAPED BY '\'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';

Try to use BCP-47 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47)

* zhe = bilingual English/Chinese subtitles --> ze
* zhc = Contonese Chinese (?)	  	    --> yue
* zht = Traditional Chinese (?)		    --> zh_TW
* spl = Latin American Spanish (?)	    --> es_149
* mne = Montenegrin (?)	       		    --> me
* ext
