The source is multilingually aligned, which is available from <a href="http://www.farkastranslations.com/bilingual_books.php">http://www.farkastranslations.com/bilingual_books.php</a>. In OPUS, the alignment is formally bilingual but the multilingual alignment can be recovered from the XCES sentence alignment files. Note also that the alignment units from the original source may include multi-sentence paragraphs, which are split and sentence-aligned in OPUS.<h3>Terms of Use</h3><p>All texts are freely available for personal, educational and research use.
