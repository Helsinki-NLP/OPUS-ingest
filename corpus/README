How to add a new corpus
-----------------------

1) make a copy of the <template> directory for your new corpus

   cp -R example MyCorpus

2) change name and information about your corpus in
   MyCorpus/Makefile.def

3) put your source text files into appropriate sub-directories in
   MyCorpus/src

   You can specify how to fetch data from the web or how to convert data files
   from other formats in MyCorpus/src/Makefile. Important is that all files
   need to be in gzipped plain text format and Unicode UTF8. They also need
   to be in language-specific sub-directories and parallel documents need
   to have the same name and path (except for the language directory).
   For example,

   MyCorpus/src/en/path/to/document1.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/en/path/document2.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/en/path/document3.txt.gz
   ...
   MyCorpus/src/fr/path/to/document1.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/fr/path/document2.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/fr/path/document3.txt.gz
   ...
   MyCorpus/src/de/path/to/document1.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/de/path/document2.txt.gz
   MyCorpus/src/de/path/document3.txt.gz

   Please, use ISO639 2-letter-codes for the language directories.
   You may also use other formats for the source documents but then you need
   to change the make procedures for converting, see
      MyCorpus/Makefile
      Makefile.preprocess
      Makefile.def

4) go to your corpus directory, run 'make corpus' (and pray)
   'make' should convert, pre-process, annotate, align all your data.
   Several steps may take very long time! Especially annotation and
   alignment can take forever. Be patient!

   You could also run make with several jobs in parallel, for example
   'make -j 4 corpus' (for 4 jobs).

5) optional: make web-information, cwb-index, various corpus formats with
   'make web-corpus'



Troubleshooting
---------------

* Annotation jobs fail

  - make sure you have all the tools necessary for the languages you work with
  - make sure that all these tools work in isolation (maybe you need to
    re-compile some of them?)
  - make sure you have all the necessary permissions for accessing
    data, directories and tools
  - check if your source files exist and have the correct character encoding


* Alignment fails

  - make sure that hunalign is installed and works
  - make sure that parallel documents have identical names (and paths)


* Make sure to run on 64-bit machines
  (some tools are compiled for 64bit architectures only!)




Making a new corpus in another directory (your own working directory)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

1) create your own OPUS home directory

   mkdir OPUS

   IMPORTANT! Use exactly this name because some path operations will
   depend on it!

2) link the 'tools' and 'lang' directory to your OPUS home

   cd OPUS
   ln -s /path/to/original/OPUS/tools .
   ln -s /path/to/original/OPUS/lang .

3) copy Makefiles and the example corpus

   mkdir corpus
   cd corpus
   cp /path/to/original/OPUS/corpus/Makefile* .
   cp -R /path/to/original/OPUS/corpus/example MyCorpus

4) do the steps from above ("How to add a new corpus") starting with step (2)
