http://askubuntu.com/questions/17823/how-to-list-all-installed-packages


-------------------------------
Create a backup of what packages are currently installed:
sudo dpkg --get-selections > installed-packages.txt

Then (on another system) restore installations from that list:
sudo dpkg --clear-selections
sudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-packages.txt

To get rid of stale packages
sudo apt-get autoremove

To get installed like at backup time
sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade
