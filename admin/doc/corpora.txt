OPUS - an open source parallel corpus


OPUS is an attempt to collect translated texts from the web, to
convert and align the entire collection, to add linguistic data, and
to provide the community with a publicly available parallel
corpus. OPUS is based on open source products and is also delivered as
an open source package. We used several tools to compile the
current corpus. Manual corrections have not been made at all.
Contributions are welcome!

OPUS so far includes about 6,000,000 words in two collections:
OpenOffice.org documentation (OO) and PHP manuals (PHP).

OO - the OpenOffice.org corpus

The original documentation of the office package OpenOffice.org
(http://www.openoffice.org/) contains 2014 English documents which
have been partly translated into 5 languages: French, Spanish,
Swedish, German, and Japanese. The original documentation in English
comprises about 500,000 words and translations contain between 400,000
and 500,000 words per language. All documents have been tokenized and,
except of the Spanish part, tagged with parts of speech. The English
part of the corpus has been marked with syntactic chunks as well.

PHP - the PHP manual corpus

PHP manuals and translations have been downloaded from
(http://www.php.net/download-docs.php). The original documents are
written in English and have been partly translated into 21
languages. The original manuals contain about 500,000 words.
The amount of actually translated texts varies for different languages
between 50,000 and 380,000 words. The corpus is rather noisy and may
include parts from the English original in some of the
translations. The corpus is tokenized and each language pair has been 
sentence aligned.
