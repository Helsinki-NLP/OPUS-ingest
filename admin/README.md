Dear IDA user,

We have good news for those who are using IDA with command line tools. With the updated tools users can now download files and folders from both staging and frozen areas and retrieve file/folder info from both areas. This includes the option to list the folder contents. There are also multiple CLI tools usage examples available in the user guide in GitHub. For more information about the update, see the changelog at https://www.fairdata.fi/en/2019-01-23-updates-to-ida-cli-tools/

Updated CLI tools are deployed on Taito and available for download from GitHub https://github.com/CSCfi/ida2-command-line-tools

Taito IDA guide has also been updated: https://research.csc.fi/csc-guide-archiving-data-to-the-archive-servers#3.2.2

If you have questions, please contact servicedesk@csc.fi

Best regards,
IDA service
