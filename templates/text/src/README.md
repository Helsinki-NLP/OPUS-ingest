# Source files

Make sure that there are text files with the same name and path in separate sub directories that indicate the language they represent. Use ISO standard 2-letter language codes. For example:

```
en
en/file1.txt
en/subdir/file2.txt
de
de/file1.txt
de/subdir/file2.txt
fr
de/subdir/file2.txt
...
```

The corpus does not need to be complete for all languages. Files may be left out for some languages but files with the same name and path should be parallel.
