<h1>CQPDemo: Search the EUROPARL corpus with CQP query.</h1>

<hr noshade width="90%" size=6 color="#0000FF" align=left>

<p>
This is an experimental search interface for parallel corpora. It uses
the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net">Corpus Work Bench (CWB)</a> as its backend and queries use
the <a href="http://cwb.sourceforge.net/files/CQP_Tutorial/">CQP query
language</a>.
</p> 
<p>
Specify a query in the text field on the left-top corner of the upper frame and press "Run query" to start the search. Note that queries may take quite some time and due to the frames it will not be visible that the system is still busy. Don't repeat the request many times. Depending on the complexity of the query this can take several seconds to see any results.
</p>
<p>
You may also
<ul>
<li>select aligned languages to be displayed</li>
<li>increase the context to be displayed</li>
<li>look at the distribution of matches per document</li>
<li>display the frequencies of matching strings</li>
</ul>
You can also show more context for each match by clicking on "context" to the left of the resulting string.
