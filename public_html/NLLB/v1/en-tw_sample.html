In wisdom Thou hast made them all.<br/>
Nyansa mu na woyɛɛ ne nyinaa;<br/>

"And seek help in patience and As-Salat (the prayer) and truly it is extremely heavy and hard except for Al-Khashi'un [i.e. the true believers in...<br/>
"Na monfa aboterɛ ne Asͻreyͻ nhwehwɛ mmoa; na ampa ara sɛ saa adeɛ yi yɛ den gyesɛ wͻnom a wͻwͻ honhom mu ahobraseɛ.<br/>
<hr/>
"By means of me [Jesus] you may have peace.<br/>
'Monam me [Yesu] so benya asomdwoe.<br/>
<hr/>
OR (for the sake of who we are linked with)<br/>
alo yɛngɛ sone,<br/>
<hr/>
You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to You.<br/>
Wosɛe wɔn a wɔnni wo nokorɛ nyinaa.<br/>
<hr/>
He then said: "I have walked before you from my youth until this day." (1 Sam.<br/>
Afei ɔkae sɛ: "Mifi me mmofraase anantew mo anim de abedu nnɛ." (1 Sam.<br/>
<hr/>
What is the reward for the faithful servants?<br/>
Akatua bɛn na ɔde bɛma wɔn a wɔde gyidi som no?<br/>
<hr/>
Those who think that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him will they return (2:46)<br/>
Nkurͻfoͻ no a wͻnim pefee sɛ wͻbɛhyia wͻn Awurade no, na wͻn adwene da so sɛ Ne nkyɛn na wͻbɛsan akͻ no" (2: 46-47).<br/>
<hr/>
Behind and before me is God and I have no fear."<br/>
mede me ho to Onyankopɔn so, na merensuro.<br/>
<hr/>
He said: "The cleanliness of this hall reflects your true faith."<br/>
Ɔkaa sɛ: "Sɛnea mo asa yi so tew kama no ma yɛhu sɛ mowɔ gyidi mapa."<br/>
<hr/>
"Those who believe and do good works, for them is pardon and a rich provision."<br/>
Allah ahyɛ nkurͻfoͻ no a wͻagye adie na wͻyͻ nwuma pa no bͻ sɛ wͻbɛnya bͻnefakyɛ ne akatua a ɛso (5:10).<br/>
<hr/>
The knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.<br/>
mepɛ Onyankopɔn ho nimdeɛ sen ɔhyew afɔre.<br/>
<hr/>
(but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.")<br/>
Nokwasɛm ni, "ɔman biara mu no, onipa a osuro [Onyankopɔn] na ɔyɛ adetrenee no, ogye no tom." - Aso.<br/>
<hr/>
See what became of the wrongdoers!<br/>
na woahu nnebɔneyɛfo asotwe.<br/>
<hr/>
Behold, My servants shall rejoice, but you shall be ashamed.<br/>
Hwɛ, me nkoa ani begye, na mo de, mo ani bewu.<br/>
<hr/>
You made all of them in wisdom.<br/>
Nyansa mu na woyɛɛ ne nyinaa;<br/>
<hr/>
Granted, from the moment you came into existence, you belonged to Jehovah, along with the rest of mankind.<br/>
Ɛwom sɛ efi bere a wobaa nkwa mu no, woyɛ Yehowa dea; wo ne nnipa a aka nyinaa.<br/>
<hr/>
after they have been created, and they<br/>
Wɔabɔ dɔnkoro ne fa.<br/>
<hr/>
(Jeremiah 3:12) When his people returned to him in genuine repentance, he forgave them.<br/>
(Yeremia 3:12) Bere a ne nkurɔfo no nuu wɔn ho nokwarem na wɔsan baa ne nkyɛn no, ɔde wɔn bɔne kyɛɛ wɔn.<br/>
<hr/>
In the resurrection, therefore, to which of the seven will she be wife?"<br/>
Ɛno nti, owusɔre bere no, nnipa baason yi mu hena na ɔbea no bɛyɛ ne yere?<br/>
<hr/>
So see how was the end of the wrongdoers<br/>
na woahunu nnebɔneyɛfoɔ asotwe.<br/>
<hr/>
"Blessed are those who do not see, and believe."<br/>
Nhyira ne wɔn a wonhui na wogye di.<br/>
<hr/>
They forgot their Creator, but worshiped his creation.<br/>
Wosii gyinae sɛ wobebu wɔn ani agu nea wɔn Bɔfo no pɛ so, na wotwaa so aba.<br/>
<hr/>
O my God. if you prayed that prayer today."<br/>
a b'a yɛrɛ wongora, a taamatɔ,<br/>
<hr/>
The one that did not create himself<br/>
Mmm hwana ɔbɔɔ realer no,<br/>
<hr/>
which he did not create<br/>
Mmm hwana ɔbɔɔ realer no,<br/>
<hr/>
(Qur'an, 2:4) Those who are aware that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him.<br/>
Nkurͻfoͻ no a wͻnim pefee sɛ wͻbɛhyia wͻn Awurade no, na wͻn adwene da so sɛ Ne nkyɛn na wͻbɛsan akͻ no" (2: 46-47).<br/>
<hr/>
11And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous;<br/>
11Afei nnipa bɛka sɛ, "Ampa ara, ateneneefoɔ kɔ so nya wɔn akatua;<br/>
<hr/>
And sinners will return to you. (ref.)<br/>
na amumɔyɛfo bɛsan aba wo nkyɛn.<br/>
<hr/>
"When will the Resurrection take place?"<br/>
Nienwu a bɛbadwazo menli a?<br/>
<hr/>
everything created by God is good.<br/>
Biribiara a Onyankopɔn abɔ no ye.<br/>
<hr/>
As a consequence, they worshiped the creation rather than the Creator.<br/>
Nnipa binom "som nneɛma a Onyankopɔn abɔ no mmom sen sɛ wɔbɛsom Ɔbɔadeɛ no ankasa."<br/>
<hr/>
On earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.<br/>
Ɔma muhuu ne gya fadum asase so na motee ne nsɛm fii ogya no mu.<br/>
<hr/>
I begin with the Name of God, The Compassionate, The Merciful<br/>
Mehyɛ ase wɔ Ɔdomfo, Mbɔbɔrhufo Nyankopɔn no Ne dzin mu.<br/>
<hr/>
in your faithfulness, destroy them.<br/>
wo nokwaredi mu, sɛe wɔn.<br/>
<hr/>
He used those who were God-fearing, trustworthy, and reliable.<br/>
Ɔpaw wɔn a wosuro Onyankopɔn, wɔyɛ anokwafo, na wɔyɛ nsi.<br/>
<hr/>
"He said, 'Tonight's the night you die.<br/>
se: obiaraaofi anadwo yi beyera== wobekumno; a.s. obene wu na<br/>
<hr/>
will shatter kings on the day of his anger.<br/>
ɔbɛdwerɛ ahemfo wɔ nʼabufuhyeɛ da no.<br/>
<hr/>
In Your faithfulness, destroy them.<br/>
wo nokwaredi mu, sɛe wɔn.<br/>
<hr/>
He answered, "By the evening everyone will die.<br/>
se: obiaraaofi anadwo yi beyera== wobekumno; a.s. obene wu na<br/>
<hr/>
Is there another god, besides the one God?<br/>
Nyamenle di nwolɛ ɛzonle ɔ?<br/>
<hr/>
In Wisdom thou hast made them all.<br/>
Nyansa mu na woyɛɛ ne nyinaa;<br/>
<hr/>
After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.<br/>
Eyi akyi no, ɔmaa atemmufo dii wɔn so kosii sɛ odiyifo Samuel bae.<br/>
<hr/>
and all of you are children of the most High."<br/>
mo nyinaa yɛ Ɔsorosoroni no mma.'<br/>
<hr/>
They are men of this world, whose reward is in this life.<br/>
asase so nnipa a wɔn akatua wɔ nkwa yi mu.<br/>
<hr/>
They are men of this world, whose reward is in this life.<br/>
asase so nnipa a wɔn akatua wɔ nkwa yi mu no.<br/>
<hr/>
Allah is with the righteous ones.<br/>
'Teefo na Onyankopɔn ne wɔn di atirimsɛm.'<br/>
<hr/>
"and indeed a greater than Solomon is here."<br/>
Nanso, deɛ ɔsene Salomo no wɔ ha.<br/>
<hr/>
He said: "It is because she shall die tonight."<br/>
se: obiaraaofi anadwo yi beyera== wobekumno; a.s. obene wu na<br/>
<hr/>
"But it is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant."<br/>
Nanso mo de, nea ɔpɛ sɛ ɔyɛ mo so panyin no nyɛ sɛ mo mu akumaa, na nea odi mo so no nso nyɛ mo mu somfo.<br/>
