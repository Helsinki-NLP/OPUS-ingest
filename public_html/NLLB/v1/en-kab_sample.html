The man is, indeed, an enigma.<br/>
Amdan, s tidep, d anekkaô n ûûeê.<br/>
<hr/>
How do we know that God did not create humans to die?<br/>
Amek i neεlem belli Ṛebbi ur sen- yebɣi ara lmut i yemdanen?<br/>
<hr/>
turn away their ears from the truth, and will turn aside to myths.<br/>
ad sɛuẓẓgen iman nsen ɣef tideț, ad rren ddehn-nsen ɣer tmucuha.<br/>
<hr/>
Allah, if you should be believers."<br/>
Ayen akk ara tessutrem s liman di tẓallit, a wen-d-ițunefk !<br/>
<hr/>
Man's anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.<br/>
axaṭer amdan ireffun ur ixeddem ara ayen yellan d lḥeqq ɣer Sidi Ṛebbi.<br/>
<hr/>
Do you think that I cannot call on my Father right now, and He will send me more than twelve legions of angels?<br/>
Eɛni tɣileḍ ur zmireɣ ara ad ssutreɣ i Baba ad iyi-d-iceggeɛ luluf n lmalayekkat ?<br/>
<hr/>
nor are they able to prove to you the things of which they are now accusing me.<br/>
Ur zmiren ara a d-awin țțbut n wayen akka i ɣef d-ccetkan fell-i.<br/>
<hr/>
(d) But many of those who heard the word believed;<br/>
Lameɛna aṭas seg wid yeslan i wawal, umnen.<br/>
<hr/>
That is a reminder for those who are mindful.<br/>
Ayagi d asmekti i wid ismektayen.<br/>
<hr/>
"He has helped his servant Israel and remembered to be merciful.<br/>
Isellek tarwa n wat Isṛail yellan d iqeddacen-is, ur ițțu ara Ṛṛeḥma-s,<br/>
<hr/>
Be thankful for the Son He has provided (His forgiveness).<br/>
Mḥemmed mmi-s n taklit, yuγal-d [yeqqel-d]<br/>
<hr/>
hypocrites were unbelievers!<br/>
Wid ur numin ara, âaégent tmejjin nnsen.<br/>
<hr/>
this is the Day of Resurrection, but 'you do not know."<br/>
Wagi d ass n tnekra, maca tellam ur tessinem."<br/>
<hr/>
The man is indeed a tyrant.<br/>
Amdan, s tidep, d anekkaô n ûûeê.<br/>
<hr/>
then sell it to idol-worshipping Hindus."<br/>
Then sell those unwan Uid t Umis w ill] yu Ul ( - Resul Us Ad.<br/>
<hr/>
(R) The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous.<br/>
Win iteddun s lḥeqq d aḥeqqi akken yella Sidna Ɛisa d aḥeqqi.<br/>
<hr/>
Thy speech is the shrine of truth (maat)."<br/>
Awal-nnek iga tidet."<br/>
<hr/>
Think that I'm not able to call on my Father, and he'd give me more than twelve legions of angels?"<br/>
Eɛni tɣileḍ ur zmireɣ ara ad ssutreɣ i Baba ad iyi-d-iceggeɛ luluf n lmalayekkat ?<br/>
<hr/>
However many of those who heard the word believed.<br/>
Lameɛna aṭas seg wid yeslan i wawal, umnen.<br/>
<hr/>
I am the merciful.<br/>
Yet I am merciful,<br/>
<hr/>
(and its community).<br/>
acku: -imezdaɣ-is ttemyallen.<br/>
<hr/>
the lord of the universe and the master of the day of reckoning.<br/>
Rebbi d nettai ittwaqesden yal ass, d netta id bab n saya, win<br/>
<hr/>
Blessed are the merciful and I want to be merciful.<br/>
Yet I am merciful,<br/>
<hr/>
They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.[1]<br/>
ad sɛuẓẓgen iman nsen ɣef tideț, ad rren ddehn-nsen ɣer tmucuha.<br/>
<hr/>
you, if you should be believers."<br/>
Ayen akk ara tessutrem s liman di tẓallit, a wen-d-ițunefk !<br/>
<hr/>
Therefore for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.<br/>
Axaṭer ur teẓrim ara lweqt i deg ara d-yas Ssid-nwen !<br/>
<hr/>
or by those whom they have instructed.<br/>
NeƔ wid mi tusna qlilet,<br/>
<hr/>
(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were over.)<br/>
Ma d lmegtin nniḍen ur d-țuɣalen ara ɣer tudert alamma ɛeddan walef iseggasen.<br/>
<hr/>
Life - It is from God, and to him it returns.<br/>
Tudert akk sɣur Yillu i d tekka yerna ɣer ɣur-s ara tuɣal.<br/>
<hr/>
Yusuf is an Arabic names.<br/>
Ma Ḍrifa (akken i yura deg udlis) d issem n taεrabt .<br/>
<hr/>
This is a reminder for those who remember.<br/>
Ayagi d asmekti i wid ismektayen.<br/>
<hr/>
Then say, "So won't you remember [Him]?"<br/>
Ini: "ihi, day ur d tesmektayem ara"?<br/>
<hr/>
you do not know what hour your Lord is coming.<br/>
Axaṭer ur teẓrim ara lweqt i deg ara d-yas Ssid-nwen!<br/>
<hr/>
That kind of persuasion does not come from the One who called you.<br/>
Ṛṛay-agi ur d-yekki ara s ɣuṛ Sidi Ṛebbi i wen-d-issawlen.<br/>
<hr/>
The merciful are shown mercy by the All-Merciful.<br/>
D iseɛdiyen wid yesɛan ṛṛeḥma deg wulawen-nsen, aaxaṭer ad iḥunn fell-asen Sidi Ṛebbi !<br/>
<hr/>
And just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so shall we[a] bear the likeness of the man from heaven.<br/>
Akken i ncuba ɣer wemdan n ddunit ara ncabi ɣer wemdan n igenwan.<br/>
<hr/>
He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy.<br/>
Isellek tarwa n wat Isṛail yellan d iqeddacen-is, ur ițțu ara Ṛṛeḥma-s,<br/>
<hr/>
saying, "Tell us the truth.<br/>
Init-asen: Tidett iɣ-temlam d tin yeskiddiben,<br/>
<hr/>
He said: "Verily, you are a people who know not.<br/>
Inna: "kunwi, s tidep, d agdud ur nessin.<br/>
<hr/>
For a man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.<br/>
axaṭer amdan ireffun ur ixeddem ara ayen yellan d lḥeqq ɣer Sidi Ṛebbi.<br/>
<hr/>
Peace and blessings, for what they are worth.<br/>
talwit γef Harun d wid akk yuklalen.<br/>
<hr/>
He has helped His servant Israel in remembrance of His mercy.<br/>
Isellek tarwa n wat Isṛail yellan d iqeddacen-is, ur ițțu ara Ṛṛeḥma-s,<br/>
<hr/>
Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body?'"<br/>
Ur teẓrim ara belli win ara yeznun nețța akk-d yir tameṭṭut ad yuɣal yid-es d yiwen ?<br/>
<hr/>
This then is how we know that we belong to the truth, and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence<br/>
S wakka ara nẓer belli di tideț i nella, yerna ad yethedden wul-nneɣ zdat Sidi Ṛebbi,<br/>
<hr/>
in whom we have forgiveness, the forgiveness of sins...<br/>
s wayes nețwasellek yerna nesɛa leɛfu n ddnubat-nneɣ.<br/>
<hr/>
and Messengers (Peace be upon them).<br/>
Amceggeɛ - imceggɛen<br/>
<hr/>
Have you not fancied so?"<br/>
Did ye no jist git yer dole?"<br/>
<hr/>
for a man's anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.<br/>
axaṭer amdan ireffun ur ixeddem ara ayen yellan d lḥeqq ɣer Sidi Ṛebbi.<br/>
<hr/>
He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy."<br/>
Isellek tarwa n wat Isṛail yellan d iqeddacen-is, ur ițțu ara Ṛṛeḥma-s,<br/>
<hr/>
The punishment (note: punishment) inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient.<br/>
Amdan-agi tlumm-it meṛṛa tejmaɛt, beṛka-t !<br/>
