Then He called out, "Father, glorify Your name!"<br/>
Insan nampikasi: "Ama, igloriam so ngaran mo."<br/>
<hr/>
"In the resurrection, then, whose wife of the seven will she be?<br/>
Kanian diad kioli, siopa ed pitora so magmaliw ya asawa na bii?<br/>
<hr/>
Sanctify them with the truth."<br/>
Pasantom ira diad panamegley na katuaan."<br/>
<hr/>
They sang songs, prayed, and discussed the Scriptures.<br/>
Mangakansion ira, manpipikasi, tan pantotongtongan day Kasulatan.<br/>
<hr/>
Even if you offer many prayers, I will not listen."<br/>
Anggano dakerakel so pikakasi yo, agko dedengelen iratan."<br/>
<hr/>
(And there is none comparable to Him),<br/>
anggapoy miparad sikato,<br/>
<hr/>
He punished you, but he will not forget you.<br/>
Dinusa to kayo, balet ag to kayo lingwanan.<br/>
<hr/>
Yet among you there are some who don't believe."<br/>
Balet agmanisia so arum ed sikayo."<br/>
<hr/>
Tell the people of Israel everything that you see."<br/>
Nepeg mon ibagad saray totood Israel iray amin a nanengneng mo."<br/>
<hr/>
You have (AD) words of eternal life.<br/>
Walad sika ray salitan mangiiter na bilay ya andi-anggaan.<br/>
<hr/>
of wrongdoers."<br/>
balet sumpa ed saray manggagaway kaogsan."<br/>
<hr/>
and teaches them His will.<br/>
tan ibabangat tod sikaray linawa to.<br/>
<hr/>
He said, "The smell of my son is like the smell of a field that has received good from the Lord.<br/>
Inkuanto, "Say balingit na anak ko singa balingit na alog a binindisionay Katawan.<br/>
<hr/>
And certainly not a matter of months,<br/>
tan ag lan balut nibilang ed saray bulan;<br/>
<hr/>
he protects them in times of trouble.<br/>
tan iyaagel to ra no panaoy gunigon.<br/>
<hr/>
A slave of slaves he will be to his brothers.<br/>
Magmaliw ya aripen na saray agagi to.<br/>
<hr/>
And they were saying to one another.<br/>
Inkuandad sakey tan sakey.<br/>
<hr/>
But if there is not, it will turn back to you."<br/>
Balet no anggapo, ompawil itan ed sikayo."<br/>
<hr/>
God has provided your food for you.<br/>
Impaiyakaran ka na Dios na kakanen.<br/>
<hr/>
this is the tale of the man who will see the end,<br/>
Saray salita na toon malinew so pakanengneng to,<br/>
<hr/>
They will be with us in Paradise.<br/>
Nakaiba tayo la ra diman ed Paraiso!<br/>
<hr/>
You will see greater things than these.."<br/>
Makanengneng ka ni na angkakabaleg a bengatla nen saraya."<br/>
<hr/>
any one who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.<br/>
Kada sakey ya ontatakot ed Dios tan manggagawa na duga et makapaliket ed sikato.<br/>
<hr/>
When the lust is conceived it gives birth to sin.<br/>
No manlokun so amoges a pilalek na laman, mananak na kasalanan.<br/>
<hr/>
We will not make anyone king; you may do whatever you think is best."<br/>
Balet ag mi gawaen ya ari so siopaman; gawam so isisipen mon sankaabigan."<br/>
<hr/>
"Yes, the Lord is our witness," they answered.<br/>
"On, say Katawan so tasi mi," ebat da.<br/>
<hr/>
And they said to one another.<br/>
Inkuandad sakey tan sakey.<br/>
<hr/>
He judged the people in righteousness.<br/>
maptek so panisintinsia tod saray katoowan.<br/>
<hr/>
and having learned of their parents'<br/>
a naaralan dad saray lalaki ra;<br/>
<hr/>
Eat and drink alongside one another.<br/>
Maninom kayo tan mandongildongil kayo.<br/>
<hr/>
They will be punished severely."<br/>
Nepeg ya ambelat so dusa ra."<br/>
<hr/>
The punishment will be harsh."<br/>
Nepeg ya ambelat so dusa ra."<br/>
<hr/>
and remain there (and in the soil) for sustained periods.<br/>
diman ira manayam ed amin a panaon,<br/>
<hr/>
For יהוה has avenged you this day of all those who rose against you."<br/>
Natad sayan agew initdan kay Katawan na pananalo ed amin da ray sinmumpad sika!"<br/>
<hr/>
This is  what the ancients were commended for.<br/>
2 Lapud pananisia, saray totoo nen inmona ran panaon nala ray maung a linawa na Dios.<br/>
<hr/>
The younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the share of the property that will belong to me."<br/>
Tan inkuan na yugtan ed ama to, 'Ama, iter mo lad siak so nabebetangan kod saray kayarian mo.'<br/>
<hr/>
Surely this is a sign of the end times.<br/>
Sikato yay tanda a mansiansia lawas,<br/>
<hr/>
You are not alone; many people still believe in God.<br/>
Agmo bukbukor; dakel ni so manisia ed Dios.<br/>
<hr/>
And (AQ) Aaron, whom He had chosen.<br/>
tan si Aaron a pinili to ra.<br/>
<hr/>
say: "I knew that before.<br/>
Say "I knew it!<br/>
<hr/>
For those who fear Allah will be gardens in the presence of their......<br/>
Saramay maunor ed Dios so manayam ed Paraiso.<br/>
<hr/>
and you will see the wicked ones destroyed.<br/>
tan nanengneng mon napagit iray totoon maoges.<br/>
<hr/>
Surely this is a sign of the End Times.<br/>
Sikato yay tanda a mansiansia lawas,<br/>
<hr/>
They disobeyed the command of their creator.<br/>
tan pakepaen day pasnuk na manamalsa ra.<br/>
<hr/>
But if not, it will return to you."<br/>
Balet no anggapo, ompawil itan ed sikayo."<br/>
<hr/>
What can we learn from the account of Aaron and the death of his sons?<br/>
Antoy naaralan tayo ed salaysay nipaakar ed si Aaron tan ed impatey na saray ananak to?<br/>
<hr/>
What a contrast to many of the powerful and wealthy in the world!<br/>
Sikatoy nidumaduma ed dakel ya maimpluensya tan mayaman ed mundo!<br/>
<hr/>
drink of them, and share with others.<br/>
Maninom kayo tan mandongildongil kayo.<br/>
<hr/>
My servants will rejoice, but you will be ashamed.<br/>
Manliket iray lingkor ko, balet nabaingan kayo.<br/>
<hr/>
Any land he gives to his sons must be from the land that is assigned to him, so that he will not oppress any of my people by taking their land."<br/>
Say dinan man a dalin ya iter tod saray anak ton lalaki et nepeg a manlapud dalin a nipabetang ed sikato, pian ag to napairap so siopaman ed saray totook diad pangala tod dalin."<br/>
